      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-1" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">If a person is a donor and the hospital staff knows it then they will not try to save</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>If a person is sick or injured for which he is admitted to the hospital, then the first priority of the medical team treating the patient would be saving his life. His information about being a donor or not is not considered at the time of treatment. This information is only notified once the all the life saving efforts have failed and the patient is determined dead. Also the medical team and the transplant team belong to different departments and they are only notified when the family of the patient has consented for donation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Rich people get preference for being recipient than common man.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>There is a single waiting list for all the recipients. Whether rich or poor, famous or common, all are considered same. What is really considered in the waiting list for organ donor is how severe is your illness and the medical condition of the patient. there are many celebrities who have gone for transplant but the fact is they also waited the same way for the donor like any other person.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">My donation is for sale in the black market.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>It is a biggest myth that the organs donated for transplant are sold in the black market to earn handsome amount. The organizations working for such cause have full records of all the candidates who made donations. Although confidential, but it is also true that the recipients record is also maintained with full transparency but not disclosed to everyone.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">My religion does not support donation.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>In this developing nation of ours the biggest religion is humanity which every religion teaches to consider at the priority. Charity and donation is a good act that is supported by all nations and religions. The feeling of spreading happiness by giving second chance at life to someone, in itself is great. All major religions support donation. it is actually the individuals choice whether he/she wants to do the charity or not.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">I don't want my family to pay after I show willingness to donate.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>It is absolutely false that one who shows willingness to donate will pay for doing the cause. Neither his family is suppose to do so. An individual&#8217;s family will only pay for the treatment undergone to save the patient&#8217;s life. After the patient is determined brain dead and has shown interest in donation then thereafter all formalities will be undertaken by the donation department for the patient&#8217;s family will not be charged anything.</p>

        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">I don't want my identity to be revealed to the recipient or his family because I don't want them to show thanks to my family and cause more grief to them.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>The donor's identity is never revealed by the donation department whether the donor likes it or not. Bu if the donor has shown interest in not to reveals his/her identity to the recipient then the action goes stricter in terms of hiding identity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title"> If I have an medical illness history, then also can I donate?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>This analysis is done by the organ donation team where the doctors evaluate the donor's history and his/her suitability for organ donation. It also varies from case to case and severity of the previous illness. Initially there were lots of conditions where a person can't donate which now have been considered safe.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title"> If I say I want to donate my heart, then they will take my all organs. Is this true?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>This is our prior responsibility to consider the patient's wish to donate his/her choice of organs. It is matter of fact that the organ donation organizations solely look after this point</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">What is the correct age to donate as I may be younger.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>There are no bars of age for organ donation now. From a newborn to an old person who is 90 years old can donate their organs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">I don't want to donate as I know the organ donation organizations treat the dead body like nothing.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Removing the organs is a surgical process where the donated organs are safely removed after which the incisions are closed. The body is kept and treated safely by the donation team keeping in view the sentiments of the family. It is similar to appendectomy, where the painful appendix is removed from the body.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title"> An open-casket funeral isn't an option for people who have donated organs or tissues.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Organ and tissue donation doesn't interfere with having an open-casket funeral. The donor's body is clothed for burial, so there are no visible sign of organ ot tissue donation.For bone donation, a rod is inserted where bone is removed. With skin donation, a very thin layer of skin similar to a sunburn peel is taken from the donor's back.Because the donor is clothed and lying on his or her back in the casket, no one can see any difference.<br>
                                Many people are uncomfortable talking about death.Explain to your loved ones how your decision to donate at the time of your death will offer hope to others whose lives can be saved or enhanced through transplantation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button id="accordion-button-5" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Tell your family.</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Make sure your family knows your wishes regarding donation.The best way to ensure that your wishes are carried out is to put them in writing.Include your wishes in your living will if you have one.If you have designated someone to make health care decisions for you if you become unable to do so, make sure that person knows that you want to be an organ donor.It's also very important to tell your family that you want to be a donor. Hospitals seek consent from the next of kin before removing organs, although this is usually not required if you're registered with  your state's donor registry.</p>
